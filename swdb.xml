<!-- Naming Convention
       hierarchy for swManufacturer: as manufacturer, National Software Reference Library
       hierarchy for swName: as manufacturer, National Software Reference Library
       swTypes: ancillary, driver, editor, file archiver, operating system, renderer, server
       swSupportedFormat: PRONOM Unique ID
-->

<!-- Quality Rating
       hierarchy: good, information, poor. definitions see below.

       swdb pursues a generalized approach. Thus the lowest quality will be chosen, if identical file types in 
       identical environments give different results.
       
       TODO: ancillary, operating system, server. set to UNDEF until definied.

       swType: renderer
         good: all information is rendered. if provided: style, markup and
               metadata information are fully  represented
         information: all information is rendered. if provided: style, markup and
               metadata are not or only partially represented
         poor: most of the information is rendered. if provided: style, markup
               and metadata are not or only partially represented
       swType: editor
         good: all information can be rendered and edited. if provided: style, markup and
               metadata information are fully represented and can be edited.
         information: all information can be rendered and edited. if provided: style, markup and
               metadata are not or only partially represented or cannot be
               edited.
         poor: most of the information can be rendered and edited. if provided: style, markup
               and metadata are not or only partially represented or cannot be
               edited.
       swType: file archiver
         good: archive can be fully extracted
       swType: driver
         good: hardware is fully supported and operating system can fully access the device
         poor: hardware is partially supported and operating system can partially access
               the device, e.g. read or write
